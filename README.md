Added logic for cyclic rotation

Our problem for the cyclic rotation challenge is basically:
A is an array of values ranging between -1000 and 1000.
N is the length of an array between 0 and 100.
K is an integer between 0 and 100.
K is the number of times the arrayâ€™s values should be shifted.
Goal
Write a function or functions that return the array shifted by the number of times desired (K)
